C# Console Application for utilizing the Chuck Norris Jokes Web API!

Issues: I had difficulty actually getting the API to work with my Console APP. I needed to instantiate a new HttpClient to aid in sending and recieving the http request and responses. The HttpClient class in C# required me to do some research on usage to get my application working.

Packages: I used the Newtonsoft.JSON NuGET package to aid in deserializing the JSON responses from the Web API. This too required research to use correctly in my program.
